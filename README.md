# MOT_Condition-A

Condition A: unselecting allowed, confidence level not allowed 

The current code allows subjects to select and unselect objects. However, once they submit their selections (by clicking on the fixation point) and they see their partners' selections they cannot change it. We need to alow subjects to be able to modify their selections based on their partners'. 

Please note your changes down here in detail.
